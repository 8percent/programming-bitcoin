Resources
=========
** There are 178 illustrations in this book.

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.

   A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.


** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** PROD: Add any authors to project that need to be added.
** Syntax highlighting: applied to 228 out of 240 code listings.

** Every single figure xref was hardcoded in the source files. I added ids and xref markup, but I would encourage Prod Ed/Copyeditor to make sure the proper figures are linked.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.

Notes at arrival in production:
==================

PE: Kristen
Source files: https://atlas.oreilly.com/oreillymedia/programming-bitcoin
Pagecount: 330
Incoming format: AsciiDoc

Notes: 
* Ch 5 has width attribute errors [Nick: FIXED. This was caused by commas used in the figure alt text]
* Ch 10 has href value errors [Nick: NOT FIXED. This is caused by missing callouts in the code block on line 267 of Chapter 10. Author will need to add callouts 4 and 5 to the code.
* Is it OK to have subscript in headers? It's showing up OK in the epub, but wanted to check if this was a big no-no [Nick: This does not cause any epubcheck problems, so I did not make any changes.]
* This book is on an abbreviated schedule, so a faster intake would be appreciated!

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Nick
