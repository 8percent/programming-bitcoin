== Chapter Title

Chapter text begins here. Replace any of this placeholder text with your opus. The following portion outlines heading levels and section structure.

=== This Is a Top-Level Heading (A-Head)

Within a chapter, the first and highest heading level uses three equals signs.

==== This Is a Second-Level Heading (B-Head)

The second-level heading uses four equals signs. This heading level should only follow a top-level heading (A-head).

===== This Is a Third-Level Heading (C-Head)

The third-level heading uses five equals signs. This heading level should only follow a second-level heading (B-head).

Next we've included a few examples of commonly used block elements. You can add these elements using the buttons in the toolbar, as well.

.This Is a Note
[NOTE]
====
Many people use notes to qualify a statement they made in the preceding paragraphs, or to warn their readers about pitfalls they might run into.
====

[WARNING]
====
This is a warning, used to alert readers to something important or encourage caution. Headings are optional for admonitions like notes and warnings.

Here is an informal code listing:

[source,python]
----
print('hello world')
----

And this is a formal listing, or example:

[[EX1]]
.Hello World in Python
====
[source,python]
----
print "Hello World"
# Formal listings have titles that will be numbered in output.
----
====

For either type of listing, you have the option of specifying the code language displayed; see http://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/ch12.html#asciidocref for more details.

You can also specify inline text as code: +print "Hello World"+.

Now, let's take a look at a figure with a caption:

Here is a blockquote with an author attribution:

[quote, Lewis Carol]
____
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

There are three types of lists available. Numbered (ordered) lists are often used to describe steps in a process:

. Parse the request.
. Choose a handler function.
. Run the handler function.

Bulleted (unordered) lists are good for describing a set of requirements:

* HTML source
* CSS stylesheets
* JavaScript code

Definition/variable lists serve as glossaries of terminology:

selectSource::
  Returns a Source containing all the IDs and values from the database. This allows you to write streaming code.
selectList::
  Returns a list containing all the IDs and values from the database. All records will be loaded into memory.
selectFirst::
  Takes just the first ID and value from the database, if available.
selectKeys::
  Returns only the keys, without the values, as a +Source+.

.Sidebar Title
****
Here's a sidebar. Sidebars are great for setting aside a section of text that is related to the surrounding content but that doesn't necessarily fit into the main flow.

Finally, here's a sample table:

.Features supported by Hadoop release series
